            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <h4>Who I am</h4>
            <p>
              I’m a curious developer and lifelong learner who enjoys solving
              problems and turning ideas into small, tangible projects. I value
              clarity, thoughtful design, and the little rituals that keep me
              focused (strong coffee, short walks, and a todo list I actually
              finish).
            </p>
            <h4>What I care about</h4>
            <p>
              I care about building useful things that help people, improving my
              craft, and growing through feedback. I try to balance speed with
              care: shipping early, but iterating responsibly.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
            <h2>Goals in this program</h2>
            <h4>Short-term</h4>
            <p>
              Complete the core assignments with confidence, ask questions
              early, and submit thoughtful work on time. I want to learn at
              least two new technical patterns and apply them in a small project
              by the midway point.
            </p>
            <h4>Long-term</h4>
            <p>
              Turn this momentum into a portfolio piece that demonstrates
              problem-solving, and use the feedback loop from mentors to refine
              my approach to architecture and testing.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
            <h4>What feels shaky</h4>
            <p>
              I’m less confident with complex state management patterns at
              scale, and with advanced performance tuning. I sometimes hesitate
              to refactor large components because I worry about breaking
              things.
            </p>
            <h4>How I plan to improve</h4>
            <p>
              Pair with a peer on one refactor each week, read one in-depth
              article or RFC per week, and write small tests that guard the most
              critical behavior before refactoring.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to future self</h2>
            <p class="note">
              Hey — if you’re reading this later, remember where you started: be
              kind to yourself. Celebrate the small wins. When things feel
              overwhelming, break them into the tiniest next action and do that.
              You learn faster than you think; keep building.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              I want to document more of my process — decisions, trade-offs, and
              what I discarded. This will help future me (and others) understand
              why certain choices were made. Also: keep a bookmarks file of
              useful articles and a short weekly log of what you learned.
