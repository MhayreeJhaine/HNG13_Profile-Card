            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <h4>Who I am</h4>
            <p>
              I’m someone who has spent time learning, building, and growing in
              tech — and now finds myself at a stage of recalibration. My skills
              feel a bit rusty, but not lost. I’m learning to rebuild slowly, to
              find rhythm again, and to remind myself that curiosity doesn’t
              fade even when confidence does.
            </p>
            <h4>What I care about</h4>
            <p>
              I care deeply about growth that’s genuine, not rushed. I value
              quiet persistence, kindness, and honest effort. I may not have
              everything figured out right now, but I’m showing up — and that
              still counts for something real.
            </p>

          <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
            <h2>Goals in this program</h2>
            <h4>Short-term</h4>
            <p>
              To regain confidence in my technical skills through consistency
              and hands-on projects. I want to take things one concept at a
              time, rebuild a strong foundation, and remind myself that progress
              is rarely loud — it’s steady.
            </p>
            <h4>Long-term</h4>
            <p>
              To reach a point where I can look at my work and feel proud again.
              I want to contribute meaningfully to projects, collaborate with
              others, and enjoy the process of learning without rushing to prove
              anything.

          <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
            <h4>What feels shaky</h4>
            <p>
              I often feel unsure about where to start when revisiting old
              concepts or trying new frameworks. Sometimes, I second-guess my
              ability to solve problems I used to handle easily. It’s not fear —
              it’s more like learning to trust myself again.
            </p>
            <h4>How I plan to improve</h4>
            <p>
              Pair with a peer on one refactor each week, read one in-depth
              article or RFC per week, and write small tests that guard the most
              critical behavior before refactoring.

          <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to future self</h2>
            <p>
              You’ve been through tougher seasons and found your way before —
              this time won’t be any different. Progress may look slow, but it’s
              real. Keep showing up, keep trying, and never forget that growth
              doesn’t always feel like confidence. Sometimes, it just feels like
              persistence.
            </p>

          <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              This stage is a recalibration. I’m learning to approach my craft
              with fresh eyes and renewed patience. I want to document more of
              my process — decisions, trade-offs, and what I discarded. This
              will help future me (and others) understand why certain choices
              were made.
